# lingograph

`lingograph` is a Go library for building LLM pipelines. It provides a
flexible, composable way to create complex conversation flows using pipeline
combinators.

## Core Concepts

`lingograph` is built around two main concepts:

### Actor

An **actor** is a component that processes conversation history and generates
responses. Actors can be:

- OpenAI LLM invocations with system prompts
- Custom implementations with specialized behavior

OpenAI-based actors can seamlessly invoke Go functions. These functions receive
structured Go data directlyâ€”no need to manually parse JSON or other formats.
This is made possible through the OpenAI Functions API, combined with Go
reflection to minimize boilerplate.

### Pipeline

A **pipeline** represents the overall structure for processing history and
generating responses. Pipelines are built from actors and composed using
combinators:

- **Chain**: executes a sequence of steps in order
- **Parallel**: runs multiple pipelines concurrently
- **Loop**: repeats a pipeline with optional limits

## Quick Start

With a working Go installation, run the following command in your project
directory:

```bash
go get github.com/vasilisp/lingograph
```

Then explore the [`examples`](https://github.com/vasilisp/lingograph/tree/main/examples) directory to see how the core concepts
fit together.
